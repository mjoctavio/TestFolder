This is a test before adding to Github Local
I now made some changes to local repo

I have fetch the changes to GitHub.com

Created a new changes. But this changes will be overwritten from
the file coming from GitHub

Integrated to PHPStorm IDE. This will test if GitHub see the changes I made locally.
Doesn't seem to update the GitHub File.
Commit was failed. Again, trying to push it to GitHub

So far the commit was a success. Trying to take another test to Confirm. Checking

There was some issue when creating a branch. Need to test again.

Works Ok. Now, try to do some changes.
